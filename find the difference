389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c=0;
        for(char a:s.toCharArray()){
            c^=a;
        }
        for(char b:t.toCharArray()){
            c^=b;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
